Dataset Characteristics and Irregularities
General Characteristics:

Total Rows: 1000
Columns: 5 (Name, Category, var1, var2, var_3)
Columns and Data Types:

Name: Randomly generated strings of 5 letters (e.g., "zOhEq", "qgvYJ").
Category: Randomly chosen from ['A', 'b', 'B', 'a', 'C'].
var1: Integers ranging from 0 to 6, normally distributed with some missing values.
var2: Integers ranging from 0 to 30, normally distributed around a mean of 15 with zero inflation and some irregular values.
var_3: Integers ranging from 0 to 8, stored as strings with some special cases.
Introduced Irregularities:

var1:
Approximately 10% of the values are missing (NaN).
var2:
Zero inflation, where about 10% of the values are set to 0.
Approximately 4% of the values are set to -999.
var_3:
Approximately 6% of the values are replaced with empty strings ("").
Approximately 2% of the values are replaced with a dot (".").
Approximately 2% of the values are replaced with "na".
Summary of Irregularities:

Missing Values:
var1 has 10% missing values.
Special Values in var2:
Contains approximately 4% of values set to -999, which can be considered as outliers or placeholder values.
Contains about 10% of values set to 0 due to zero inflation.
Special Values in var_3:
Contains 6% empty strings, 2% dots, and 2% "na" values, indicating potential issues with data entry or encoding.
